# 64ordle-Solver
Program that automatically solves 64 wordles at once, puzzles taken from https://64ordle.au

This program is built in Python 3.10 and so in order to run this program, the user is required to have Python v3.10 or later installed.
Secondly, this program relies heavily on the python Selenium module, version 4.1.3 and so this too (or a later version) is required. Use `pip install selenium` to install the module.

This program requires the user to have downloaded the driver for the browser they wish to use.
Browser drivers can be found here: https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/index.html#drivers
The user must edit the code as it appears in the .py file, to change the name of the browser to be used and change the path to the browser driver.
